# Bitcoin-price-prediction
# Design

The project will use a supervised machine learning approach to predict Bitcoin's price. The model will be trained on historical Bitcoin price data and a variety of features, such as news sentiment and social media activity. The model will then be used to predict future Bitcoin prices.

# Software Requirements

The project will use the following software:
•	Python
•	Scikit-learn
•	Pandas
•	Numpy
•	Matplotlib


 
# Methodology

The project will follow the following methodology:
1.	Collect historical Bitcoin price data.
2.	Clean and preprocess the data.
3.	Select a machine learning algorithm.
4.	Train the model on the historical data.
5.	Evaluate the model's performance.
6.	Use the model to predict future Bitcoin prices.
K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

The K-nearest neighbor algorithm is a simple machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. The algorithm works by finding the k most similar instances to a new instance and then using the labels of those instances to predict the label of the new instance.

Naive Bayes Algorithm

The Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification tasks. The algorithm works by assuming that the features of an instance are independent of each other and then using Bayes' theorem to predict the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.









# Future Scope

The project can be extended in a number of ways, including:
•	Exploring the use of additional machine learning algorithms
•	Incorporating additional features into the model
•	Developing a mobile app that allows users to track Bitcoin's price and make predictions
# Conclusion

This project will explore the use of machine learning to predict Bitcoin's price. The project will provide valuable insights into the potential of machine learning for predicting cryptocurrency prices.
